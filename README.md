# website

This is the code for shucksandsugar.com

This project is underdevelopment. The code is all in one package, but the development goals are split in to a two different steps: function and design. The function is being developed in python, with Flask acting as the interface between the html and the python code. The design is encapsulated by the html and css.


FUNCTION
The point of the website is to allow users to perform a search that will help them to solve cryptic crosswords. It should be easy to use, with the code adapting to the user's needs.

DESIGN
The website will have a simple and clean design.

In order to run this application, the user can change working directory into the top folder 'website' and then

./RUN.sh
