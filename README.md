# shucks

This is the code for shucksandsugar.com. This project is under development.

shucksandsugar.com will be a website application aimed at helping users solve cryptic crosswords. It is a Flask-based application. Currently, the functionality is written in python, though in future a word-list database will be created which will be queried with SQL.

The application itself is in the folder "shucks", and will be hosted on Google Cloud Platform.
